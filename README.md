### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ :it:

 about me:
_I have been both a student and a worker at the same time. I graduated in Environmental and Natural Sciences from the University of Turin. I have always had a strong passion for the environment and the IT world. In recent years, I've developed a keen interest in programming, particularly in the Java language. While I'm still a novice, I am highly motivated to enhance my skills. In my profile, you can find some projects I have attempted to work on._
